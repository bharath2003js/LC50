    "\n",
    "## Project Title\n",
    "Prediction of LC50 Value using Quantitative Structureâ€“Activity Relationship (QSAR) Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "The LC50 prediction project aims to leverage QSAR models to predict the LC50 values of chemical compounds, crucial for assessing their ecological toxicity. By utilizing data from the ECOTOX Database and ECHA, this project develops and deploys machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), with an ensemble approach to enhance predictive accuracy. The Flask API serves as the interface for users to input molecular descriptors and receive real-time predictions. Deployed on Azure Web Services, the project demonstrates the application of data science in environmental risk assessment, providing scalable and accessible predictions.\n",
